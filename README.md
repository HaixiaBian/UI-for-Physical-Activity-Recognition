# 
This web UI allows users to define physical activities for the project "Physical Activity Recognition Using Wearable Technologies." JavaSript is the main programming language for this project, and Blokly (a library for adding drag and drop block coding for an application) is the framework.  
# Main tasks: 
•	Developed an interactive UI for defining movement patterns for physical activity recognition (Zero-shot learning)
•	Implemented physical activity patterns data storage and transformation between XML, JSON, and tree representations
•	Visualized real-time fuzzy matches between activities by ranking with the tree edit distance algorithm to guide users
